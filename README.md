## Things Grehg Learned

- use Dave's method of getting this release's version, which is leveraging git's tagging
- you can prefix your branch name with your name
- when install Docker for the first time on a fresh linux machine [this link](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/how-to-fix-docker-got-permission-denied-while-trying-to-connect-to-the-docker-daemon-socket may help with permission errors and [this link](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/how-to-fix-docker-got-permission-denied-while-trying-to-connect-to-the-docker-daemon-socket) may help with python issues with docker
- when installing neovim, if the begin block is not understood you must install the neovim plugin manager [here](http://www.linode.com/docs/tools-reference/tools/how-to-install-neovim-and-plugins-with-vim-plug/)
- vim command `f`, finds the first instance of what you type next
- vim command `;` repeats that command again, can use with `f` to find 2nd, 3rd, 4th
- vim command `ci` "change inside", so you can run `ci[` to change everything inside a [] brace, deleting everything and inserting. works with quotes, brackets, parenthesis, etc
- vim command `ct` very similar to ci, but its not inside bounding things, but change from cursor to next thing. change from cursor to character you provide and automatically swaps you into insert mode
